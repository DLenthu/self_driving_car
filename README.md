# self_driving_car

This simulator is an open source unity based car simulator.
It has 2 modes of operation.
1) Manual (used to collect data)
2) Autonomous (used to test car with the trained model)


Here I am training a CNN to output a steering angle and throttle value given the image of the road.
The road can be viewed from 3 different angles {right,middle,left}
